## The configuration below would get you a server ready to run https sites at:
## dev1.example.com and dev2.example.com
## the domain or subdomain where the sites you build will be accessed
## For this to be accessed by others, you need one of:
#  1) proper DNS entries
#  2) a service like ngrok
httpd_dn_suffix: 'example.com'
## Your email address
email: 'user@example.com'
## Let's encrypt cert paths
#httpd_cert_path: '/vagrant/letsencrypt/etc/live/'
#httpd_key_path: '/vagrant/letsencrypt/etc/live/'
## Self-signed cert paths
httpd_cert_path: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/'
